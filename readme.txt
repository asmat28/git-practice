Git was introduced as a version control tool, described as a folder on the internet that enables multiple users to access and modify code collaboratively. This method was presented as a better alternative to using email or file sharing services for code collaboration. The role of Git in facilitating code sharing and change tracking among team members was explained.

Git Structure and Use Cases
The structure of Git was illustrated using an analogy of local and internet-based folders. Emphasis was placed on the use of repositories as internet-based shared spaces. The difference between public and private repositories was discussed, along with the process of creating repositories on GitHub, a widely-used Git hosting service.

Git Branching and Version Control
The concept of branching in Git was covered in detail. Separate branches—such as main, develop, and testing—were explained as mechanisms for independent code development and version control. It was highlighted that branching allows for parallel development and testing without impacting the main codebase. Although Git does not enforce coding standards related to branching, it was recommended to maintain consistent code types within a repository.
